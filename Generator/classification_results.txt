Puts Enron On Rating Watch Negative Fitch NY October 25 2001 Fitch places the following Enron securities on Rating Watch Negative senior unsecured debt ` BBB+ subordinated debt ` BBB preferred stock ` BBB ` and commercial paper ` F2 Pipeline subsidiary ` A ` rated senior unsecured debt at Northern Natural Gas Co and Transwestern Pipeline Co are also placed on Rating Watch Negative The rating action primarily relates to the negative capital market reaction to recent disclosures by the company The loss of investor and counterparty confidence if it continues would impair Enrons financial flexibility and access to capital markets therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business On Oct 16 2001 Enron announced a $ 1 billion after tax charge to earnings to be taken in the third quarter of 2001 and a reduction of balance sheet equity by $ 12 billion relating to the unwinding of structured transactions Since that time there have been several damaging news reports on the company and its management More importantly investors have voiced concerns Enrons common stock price has plummeted and spreads on its debt have widened The company has attempted to quell rumors and has publicly stated that it has adequate liquidity to conduct its business Approximately $ 15 billion of unused liquidity is available under committed bank lines An additional concern is that certain structured transactions of the company including Marlin Water Trust II and Osprey could unwind While various sources of repayment exist such as the sale or liquidation of underlying assets or an equity offering primary credit support is derived from the Enron obligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock if an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not been deposited with the trustee 120 days prior to the maturity date or upon a note trigger event In the event that the issuance of the preferred stock yields less than the amount required to redeem the senior notes in either case Enron is required to deliver additional shares If Enron can not or does not deliver on its obligation then the amount of the deficiency becomes a payment obligation of Enron representing a general unsecured claim While trigger events include a downgrade of Enrons senior unsecured debt below investment grade by one of the major rating agencies in conjunction with specified declines in Enrons closing stock price over three consecutive trading days Enron would have a forebearance period of 60 days as long as an attempt was being made to register the shares The total amount of Marlin and Osprey debt is approximately $ 32 billion Enron has not verified that the underlying assets have adequate market value to fully pay down the associated debt While capital market uncertainties have escalated Fitch has no information to indicate that there are any fundamental problems with Enrons core wholesale retail and pipeline businesses Fitch expects to be in contact with the company on a continuing basis to both monitor ongoing events and address strategic longer term issues STOCKWATCH Enron higher after dismissing CFO Fastow 10/25/2001 AFX News c 2001 by AFP Extel News Ltd NEW YORK AFX Share of Enron were higher in opening trade after the company dismissed its chief financial officer Andrew Fastow due to his past involvement in running two partnerships in which Enron had invested dealers said At 956 am Enron was up 113 usd or 695 pct at 1755 The DJIA was down 13860 points at 920752 the S & P 500 index was down 1595 pts at 106900 and the Nasdaq composite down 3902 at 169252 Enron said it named Jeff McMahon CFO to replace Fastow after announcing Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into the Fastow related transactions In my continued discussions with the financial community it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO said chief executive Kenneth Lay in a statement Enron shares have fallen sharply in recent days on concerns over financial transactions made with the two partnerships LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co Investment LP which analysts said could affect future earnings and which have prompted class action suits against the company McMahon who had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enrons Industrial Markets group had quit his job as treasurer last year after voicing concerns within the company about Fastows role in running the two partnerships according to the Wall Street Journal This morning Salomon Smith Barney analyst Raymond Niles downgraded Enron to buy speculative from buy high risk to reflect his concerns that lingering uncertainty over financial practices may begin to impair Enrons commercial operations This is the least likely outcome in our view but one whose likelihood has increased over the last week as questions continue to be asked he said ng/lj For more information and to contact AFX wwwafxnewscom and wwwafxpresscom Copyright 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc All Rights Reserved =DJ Concerned Energy Cos Make Few Changes In Enron Dealings 2001 10 25 1413 New York By Mark Golden Kristen McNamara Jon Kamp and John Edmiston Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES NEW YORK Dow Jones Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit quality of troubled Enron Corp ENE but they have made almost no changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas the companies said Thursday The concerns have arisen because Enron which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the countrys power and gas markets has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure Moodys has put Enrons credit on watch for possible downgrade and some of the companys debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron said John Sousa chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc DYN Its business as usual Williams Cos WMB spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company too has made no changes and has no concerns about Enrons credit Another Top 10 power and gas trading company Aquila ILA has also left Enron credit unchanged Other companies expressed concern though theyve taken little if any action Like everyone else in the marketplace were proceeding with caution said Lora Kinner director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel SA Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesnt expect to make any drastic changes Calif Guarantees Allow Williams To Book Power Revenues By Andrew Dowell Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 10/25/2001 Dow Jones Energy Service Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc NEW YORK Dow Jones Clarifications by California as to what electricity transactions the state will back enabled Williams Cos WMB to book $ 180 million in power sales from the previous period as third quarter revenues the company said Thursday The revenues came from power Williams sold through the California Independent System Operator which runs the states wholesale power market and clears and settles transactions The state of California has paid more than $ 11 billion for power bought directly from suppliers but has yet to pay for any ISO power since it took over the job of buying power for the states ailing utilities in mid January Two weeks ago however the state made clear for the first time which ISO transactions it would back Its that fact that has allowed us for the first time to recognize dollars from sales to the California ISO Williams Chief Operating Officer Steven Malcolm said on a conference call Wednesday Williams reported third quarter net income of $ 2213 million on revenues of $ 281 billion up from $ 1211 million on revenues of $ 233 billion in the same period the year before Williams is now in talks with California to secure payment for its ISO sales The process is complicated by the states role as guarantor of transactions undertaken on behalf of the utilities which arent creditworthy enough to buy power for themselves The ISO didnt envision third party guarantors when it set up its settlement process and state accounting rules require more detailed bills than those sent out by the ISO each month state power officials have said The state says it has set aside $ 12 billion to cover ISO transactions As reported suppliers including Williams had charged the state with deliberately muddling the repayment issue to keep power flowing for free Willing To Renegotiate Separately Williams officers also said the company was willing to discuss reworking its long term contracts with California provided the result benefited both parties California Gov Gray Davis is under heavy fire for having locked the state into contracts running as long as 20 years at prices negotiated at the peak of a market that has since collapsed Both sides could potentially benefit from changes to the length of the term of the contracts or the specifics of power supply obligations perhaps freeing up supply that Williams thinks it could get more money for on the spot market Malcolm said Were always willing to sit down with a customer Malcolm said Williams hasnt been approached by the state to renegotiate the contracts Malcolm said Any attempt by California to force through one sided changes is unlikely and could backfire for the state by disrupting plans for new power plants he said To the extent contracts are changed financing is going to go away he said Downplaying Enron Opportunities Williams downplayed its ability to capitalize on the recent troubles of market leader Enron Corp ENE saying it focuses on large long term structured deals not the high volume physical market transactions that Enron dominates Malcolm said Also TradeSpark the Internet based energy exchange in which Williams is a partner is limited for now in its ability to expand and take volume from Enrons proprietary system EnronOnline because of the horrific losses operator Cantor Fitzgerald XCFZ suffered in the attacks on the World Trade Center Thats interrupted the rapid growth we were seeing Williams Chief Executive Keith Bailey said on the call Enron which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the countrys power and gas markets and which makes a market for those commodities on EnronOnline has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure Those concerns have raised questions about the business model of EnronOnline a platform on which Enron is the counterparty in all trades Those concerns could eventually boost volume on neutral exchanges like TradeSpark We continue to believe in the neutral platform that TradeSpark offers Malcolm said TradeSpark LP was formed by eSpeed Inc ESPD Cantor Fitzgerald XCFZ Shell RD unit Coral Energy Dominion D Koch Energy Trading Inc TXU Corps TXU TXU Energy unit and

session sorting through a mountain of earnings reports said Peter Cardillo director of research at Westfalia Investments Among companies that announced quarterly earnings so far Dow Chemical said third quarter net income plunged 84 % hurt by weak demand substantial price declines and a slew of charges mostly related to acquisition expenses and restructuring at Dow Corning Among other stocks to

which has just been youve been talking about it quite a bit David how could you not talk about it Seventy six million shares yesterday down fifty percent in the last two weeks This is a company with what a hundred million in revenues James Cramer guest market commentator Maybe Kernen Yeah right Anyone who does any trading in energy apparently you know uses Enron Online so anything that destabilizes Enron to a great extent could destabilize the whole energy trading arena and Cramer Go ahead say it Say what youre thinking No one has said it yet We know the truth We believe that Enron caused a national short squeeze They knew every single number in this gas situation They wrecked the California utility system and profited from it Thats my bet My bet that this they had look they were the market maker Imagine if Instinet knew what you were going to be buying and took it ahead of you I think they cornered the market for electricity for about four months made a huge fortune and now the company is unraveling and when someone when the Justice Department gets in there were going to discover this Kernen Lets see what happened Haines Now wait a second David Faber co anchor Whoa whoa whoa The Justice Department Jim Now is that new Is that something Cramer No that would be if I were a prosecutor something Faber OK so they are not being investigated Cramer Well no Im actually being a little forward thinking Kernen The SEC wants documents about the limited partnership transactions of Mr Faber Which is very different from what Jim is talking about Cramer No Im saying that this is what if I were an enterprising prosecutor I would say Did we have a nationwide short squeeze in electricity caused by one company that had access to all the screens and knew exactly what was happening with the electricity market which then wrecked the California utility system cost the consumer billions of dollars and is now being hushed up Kernen Well lets talk about the actual news Heres yesterdays trading Haines Wait a minute Kernen Well I just want to say that the guy is gone now Thats the new news here Did you read did you know that Fastow after four Faber Late yesterday Kernen Yeah after four oclock Fastow is gone Whats interesting Faber Hes the CFO Kernen But hes a new CFO Faber who benefitted personally from some of these off balance sheet partnerships Cramer Mark you know Im not on thin ice here Im not on thin ice Haines I just want to make sure we understand that this is your theory Cramer This is my theory Haines OK Cramer It is just a theory It is my opinion But I think weve got to find out more about that short squeeze that occurred Haines OK Cramer We need to find out whether it was orchestrated Kernen The new CFO might help regain some credibility for the company because he was the old treasurer who left that position a year or so ago because of some disagreements with how Mr Fastow was doing business apparently So now hes back as CFO and well whether that calms the market down Faber Well what they need to do Joe they need to come clean I mean that is what all the investors in Enron and those whove left the company as investors over this last week have wanted Lets see everything be as transparent as you possibly can be tell us exactly what we need to know And as much as they need to come clean with their investors they need to come clean with their trading counterparties because that is really what people are concerned about Kernen Why is the credit worthiness issue such a big deal Anyone who does trading with them if their credit worthiness were to go if their credit rating were to go down how would that affect energy trading Faber Well you want to know that theyre going to be there on the other side and make good on the trades Kernen I guess you would wouldnt you Faber Right Not that they arent but why would you if you can trade with seven other guys seven other companies maybe you cut back a little bit on your exposure there Kernen Now why would Faber And that would hurt their core business Kernen Why are people expecting some type of action from the credit agencies not because of the stock price right Because of something that could unravel Faber Because of something related to these liabilities they may have Kernen That they dont know about at this point Faber that they may have with regard to funding some of these off balance sheet partnerships that they backstopped in terms of borrowing that went on at the project level at the off balance sheet partnership Will it be a liability They dont know But thats one of the reasons Kernen Were talking hundreds of millions or billions Faber They dont know Kernen But there were billions of dollars in limited partners Faber Yes About three billion in financing I think is what some analysts estimated Kernen This is a pretty big number Faber Yeah they can get to most of that with the assets that they have in the partnerships themselves Kernen I use a six month chart to show whats happened over the last two weeks You got to look at here But if we went back a year youd see eighty as far as the high for Enron Now were at sixteen Faber Everybody else took a hit yesterday Dynegy got hurt Kernen Well I got Dynegy next Dont Here we go Faber Im sorry Im getting a little excited Kernen You are Faber Enthusiastic about your charts Kernen Theres a weekly chart of Dynegy and you know whats coming next dont you Now Im worried about the utility average Ive worried about the transportation average a lot in my career Mark now the utilities have replaced my worries Im angst ridden Did you see this chart Were breaking below the Cramer Thats a positive not a negative Joe Kernen Whats wrong with Cramer today What happened Cramer Im all fired up Faber He really is My God hes got the DOJ getting all crazy the FBI the CIA You going down to En you going down to Houston yourself Cramer I may just have to I may have to clean up that whole city Kernen Jim why would the thats the now getting down to the lows I mean the other averages have come back quite a bit from the post attack lows the utilities are retesting those Thats not something to worry about Cramer No because I think theres a lot of money going into more cyclical issues I think the economy is showing signs of getting better The consumer is certainly much stronger than we thought The base book didnt say the corporate was strong but the consumer is strong Much stronger than before Kernen All right In the past people have worried about the utility averages being a leading indicator though I dont were talking about four hundred to two ninety at this point Thats a long way Cramer This average has got a lot of problems to it but I still think that Kernen Its no longer the Cramer you sell this as safety We dont want safety as much as we want a little bit more reciprocality # # #

Email body:ill pay a grand total of 0 Eva Pao epao @ mba2002hbsedu on 05/10/2001 051559 PM Please respond to epao @ mba2002hbsedu To jarnold @ enroncom cc Subject try this one Please read the following problem very carefully and write in a number at the end You should be ready to defend your answer Only a number is allowed not an algebraic equation Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A the acquirer which is currently considering acquiring Company T the target by means of a tender offer You plan to tender in cash for 100 % of Company Ts shares but are unsure how high a price to offer The main complication is this the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking Indeed the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome If the project fails the company under current management will be worth nothing $ 0/share But if the project succeeds the value of the company under current management could be as high as $ 100/share All share values between $ 0 and $ 100 are considered equally likely By all estimates the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management In fact whatever the ultimate value under current management the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T If the project fails the company is worth $ 0/share under either management If the exploration project generates a $ 50/share value under current management the value under Company A is $ 75/share Similarly a $ 100/share value under Company T implies a $ 150/share value under Company A and so on The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company Ts shares This offer must be made now before the outcome of the drilling project is known From all indications Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A provided it is at a profitable price Moreover Company T wishes to avoid at all cost the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press Thus you Company A will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer In addition Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the per share value of the company under current management Thus if you offer $ 50/share for instance Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $ 50 As the representative of Company A you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $ 0/share this is tantamount to making no offer at all to $ 150/share What price offer per share would you tender for Company Ts stock $ ______ per/share

Email body:Fred There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon 2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint heres a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months I shouldnt have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out It has been 10 days since we traded and we havent received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for We did not trade 300 contracts per day it was per month do you guys even think before you type I am a CFO and an accountant and I cant decipher what you are trying to confirm here From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers One upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare they couldnt rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm This was a captive client who and needs to trade who will not show us their flow again The latest is the most disturbing we just want to do a small trade to test your system We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details not one phone call to confirm the tradenothing We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently Well clearly we failed We do not understand what is going on in the back office Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business Is there too much turnover How are they trained Who is in charge of the backoffice There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process who co ordinates all their efforts Does anyone care Ok Ill stop For our part we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her We have to stop this before we lose clients which we will All the problems are being caused by the following 1 Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients This has already cost us money this year Our clients do 10 trades a day they are constantly in and out of positions it is imperative that we get these right As well this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system There are hundreds of books at Enron We have postions on with dozens of them We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot We have to select books one by one this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow Michelle is in charge of this process We need a IT person on this yesterday Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates Robyn Russell and I check it everyday there are always mistakes 2 There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them There is no check after they have been imput There are ALWAYS imput errors Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals We have no idea where our job ends and the book admins starts for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish 2a Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered what if deals are imput incorrectly the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client Going forward confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct 2b Invoicing there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done 3 EOL We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here we have signed Renaissance up a 10B program fund but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks 4 Credit All of our clients are margined If deals are in the system incorrectly the wrong MTM goes to the client another mis match We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients this amount changes daily we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through again we are doing this now

Email body:Hi thought youd want to know some of the recent equity comments from a few of the funds Bad comments first ENE Ospraie one of the Tudor funds has actually been reducing all their trading exposure to us becuase of our credit situation At one point they probably had a 12000 contract short gas position with us where we might have 1000 lots on now They have studied our financials for the last 2 years and like the rest of wall street can not determine how to value us I think the bigger concern though is our credit line situation Its been leaked that the availability of our borrowing is linked to stock price obviously the street does not know the real details but the fact these rumors are out there and lack of statements by us to the contrary are causing some to panic Ive heard the same come out of SAC which is a 5 B equity shop who also put on the favorite short ENE SAC has just started trading with us I am not sure what to do about this luckily Ospraie is the only group commenting on our credit I am not having any problems YET with any of the banks except CSFB and thats not new I have not been able to trade with them for the last year I am anticipating problems which is why I am trying to work out a clearing system in the interim I am sure Ken will do a better job of putting some of these fears to rest and the street will be able to assign us a PE in line with other trading companies 8 10 plus some growth component 5 for developing businesses And at $ 20 they reckon we get taken out anyway the fact remains that Enron has major franchise value Good news Ospraie covered their short at $ 30 when PGE resiolution came out Thursday and we rallied $ 4 Other comments from Catequil they generally think a lot of the energy sector E+Ps are close to bottom They also commented that they are likely to buy El Paso at a 105 PE soon even though ours is currently 125 and they believe in us because they just have more access to El Paso Sr Mgmt and understand their biz better Lot of El Paso and Dynegy support out there They were never short us On other names EOG could see it down to $ 22 but see $ 35 based on NAV more realistic Like EOG and Chesapeake well hedged Also like Philips/ Statoil on the Alaskan gas play as well as the fact that they have 0 mid east exposure Like Talisman only has exposure in Sydan Nexus Yemen

Email body:PLEASE TREAT AS CONFIDENTIAL A source had a meeting today with California state treasurer Phil Angelides Here are the main points from their conversation 1 Anglelides Certain that SoCal Will Go Bankrupt Corroborating our line over the past four months Anglelides stated with confidence that SoCal would go bankrupt and that he was surprised they hadnt already He noted that the only reason they havent yet is that they were too stupid to ring fence the parent and that their two biggest equity holders were screaming not to do it He added that the Davis/SoCal MOU is dead and that all the Plan Bs are speculative at best He also thought that SoCal was being naive if they thought they would get a better deal from the legislature than from the bankruptcy court 2 Bond Issuance $ 12B Not Enough Angelides conceded that a $ 12B bond issue would not be enough to buy power for the summer and that the true costs would probably be $ 18 24B The only reason they didnt issue more is that Angelides felt that $ 12B was all the market could handle The current game plan for bonds assumes an average peak price for power of $ 400/MWh which Angelides said explains the difference between his estimates and the higher estimates from State Comptrollers Kathleen Connells office 3 New Generator Construction Anglelides was explicit that the California Public Power Authority authorized by the legislature last week will build plants and not stop until we California has a 10 15 % capacity cushion above expected demand Angelides expects the state to be 5 10 % short on power all summer

Email body:Savita Attached is the latest Robotrader spreadsheet As you may recall we tried several different approaches to minimizing the cost of the market running up and then down again The solution which gave the best solution was also the simplest one Principles as follows Basically an advanced Offset to Last Trade Definitions Intensity Measures the length of time between transactions as a rolling average over the last x number of transactions the Intensity Factor Intensity Factor The number of transactions used in calculating the rolling average Intensity Dead Interval The period of time in which if nothing occurs an event or transaction is deemed to take place Offset Reversion Ratio The percentage by which the Offset will be reduced if a Dead Interval passes Spread Minimum The minimum spread which can be used Offset Minimum The minimum offset which may be used Spread Offset Minimum The minimum amount by which the spread must exceed the offset Spread Reversion Rate The amount in dollars by which the spread will decrease if a Dead Interval passes Position Sensitivity The position which if exceeded will cause the V Factor Adjustment to increase V Factor adjust The amount by which the Momentum will be increased if the Position Sensitivity is exceeded Momentum The measure of the degree to which the market is either just buying or just selling Adjusted Momentum A Momentum number which may be boosted causing a larger price reaction when the Position Sensitivity is exceeded Offset The amount by which a bid or offer will be increased/decreased when a transaction occurs Spread The difference between the bid and the offer General Principles and Mechanics As each Sell Buy occurs the Momentum decreases increases The Adjusted Momentum is the same as the Momentum unless the Position Sensitivity is exceeded If the Position Sensitivity is exceeded then the Adjusted Momentum is boosted by the V Factor Adjustment The Offset is calculated by looking up the Offset value on a table for the specified Adjusted Momentum The Spread is calculated by looking up the value to boost decrease the Spread on a table for the Specified Intensity As the Intensity value drops the Spread widens As it increases the Spread decreases In a running market the offset will increase quickly If it establishes a new level the Offset will slowly decrease If the market runs up and whipsaws back the offset will stay large If a market range trades the offset will trend to zero If there are a large number of transaction in succession the spread will widen If there are a small number of transactions in succession the spread will tighten Dave

Email body:Phillip here is the breakdown on new deals and option values for Sept 24 Options Sold put with strike of 150 and volume of 30800 Sold put with strike of 220 and volume of 92400 Buy put with strike of 175 and volume of 61600 Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30800 Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30800 Buy put with strike of 125 and volume of 30800 Total new deal value $ 3552534 Value in exercising of deals liquidations $ 3642100 Net value to book = $ 89566 The reason for the difference in new deal value for LT NW between the new deal report and the DPR of approx $ 2290630 was due to the fact that one of the swaps that was entered for the exercised options was incorrect The correct value was determined by running a minibook and the difference was $ 2290630 and so the new deal value was adjusted accordingly John

Email body:Sources at OPS indicate that once OPS completes its review of line 1110 and approves it to come back online there is no formal process to grant El Paso permission to bring the entire system back to full capacity at 11 bcf/d Therefore once the inspection/repairs are completed by El Paso the company will seek permission from OPS to resume to full service OPS would probably grant them approval within a matter of days The uncertainty still lies in the time it will take to interpret pigging data and for OPS to conduct its review

Email body:Hi thought youd want to know some of the recent equity comments from a few of the funds Bad comments first ENE Ospraie one of the Tudor funds has actually been reducing all their trading exposure to us becuase of our credit situation At one point they probably had a 12000 contract short gas position with us where we might have 1000 lots on now They have studied our financials for the last 2 years and like the rest of wall street can not determine how to value us I think the bigger concern though is our credit line situation Its been leaked that the availability of our borrowing is linked to stock price obviously the street does not know the real details but the fact these rumors are out there and lack of statements by us to the contrary are causing some to panic Ive heard the same come out of SAC which is a 5 B equity shop who also put on the favorite short ENE SAC has just started trading with us I am not sure what to do about this luckily Ospraie is the only group commenting on our credit I am not having any problems YET with any of the banks except CSFB and thats not new I have not been able to trade with them for the last year I am anticipating problems which is why I am trying to work out a clearing system in the interim I am sure Ken will do a better job of putting some of these fears to rest and the street will be able to assign us a PE in line with other trading companies 8 10 plus some growth component 5 for developing businesses And at $ 20 they reckon we get taken out anyway the fact remains that Enron has major franchise value Good news Ospraie covered their short at $ 30 when PGE resiolution came out Thursday and we rallied $ 4 Other comments from Catequil they generally think a lot of the energy sector E+Ps are close to bottom They also commented that they are likely to buy El Paso at a 105 PE soon even though ours is currently 125 and they believe in us because they just have more access to El Paso Sr Mgmt and understand their biz better Lot of El Paso and Dynegy support out there They were never short us On other names EOG could see it down to $ 22 but see $ 35 based on NAV more realistic Like EOG and Chesapeake well hedged Also like Philips/ Statoil on the Alaskan gas play as well as the fact that they have 0 mid east exposure Like Talisman only has exposure in Sydan Nexus Yemen

Email body:John I appreciate your allowing us to use your enclosed office for Ken Lay video applications In testing the equipment today I realized for the first time that our fiber feed involved that big black box that youve undoubtedly noticed I was unaware that that would be necessary We really view this as temporary because we are planning to move all video activity to the new building before the end of the year However if you would prefer I can request to have the box moved out and a fixture put in your wall Thanks again John Vance Meyer

Email body:Phillip The purpose of this e mail is to explain the results of our discussions with the technical team after our meeting with you We need to get your approval of the points listed below so that we can begin building the application We can have the Position and P & L Reports show the results of the learners decisions in previous periods which will allow the learner move forward in time with wrong answers This will achieve our goal of giving the learners more rope and letting them see the results of their mistakes In order to achieve this we will have the following constraints The feedback will be fairly high level as we discussed in Thursdays meeting We will be able to provide feedback on cumulative P & L and positions but not about specific actions the learner took in a previous period We will not for example be able to say things like In November when we were headed into a cold winter you chose to withdraw gas What you should have done was We can not save the P & L and position numbers This means that if the learner leaves the simulation returns to the main menu or experiences a computer crash his decisions will not be saved and he will need to start over at time period one We can not have the learner calculate P & L on storage costs transportation costs or hedging instruments This is because the right answer and the available answer choices would have to depend on the decisions the learner has made Now that the learner can go down any path he chooses the number of possible answers is extremely large and the right answers are variable I believe these tasks will be actually better if we dont have the learner calculate P & L because he has already calculated P & L numerous times in the structurer/customer scenarios and conversion and arbitrage scenarios Furthermore the type of feedback we would have to give about specific P & L numbers will not flow well with the high level global type feedback we are now planning to give in this task We can not export price numbers into Excel because the Indeliq framework does not support the downloading of data into external applications The technical effort required to add this functionality far exceeds our current development budget We can however do some calculations for the learner on the screen We can also try to somehow allow the learner to make the mistake of using future prices instead of discounted prices If you could please respond with your approval or concerns by end of day Wednesday it will allow us to move forward with the development of this simulation I would be happy to discuss these points with you please let me know if you would like to set up a meeting Thank you Mery This message is for the designated recipient only and may contain privileged or confidential information If you have received it in error please notify the sender immediately and delete the original Any other use of the email by you is prohibited

Email body:ill pay a grand total of 0 Eva Pao epao @ mba2002hbsedu on 05/10/2001 051559 PM Please respond to epao @ mba2002hbsedu To jarnold @ enroncom cc Subject try this one Please read the following problem very carefully and write in a number at the end You should be ready to defend your answer Only a number is allowed not an algebraic equation Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A the acquirer which is currently considering acquiring Company T the target by means of a tender offer You plan to tender in cash for 100 % of Company Ts shares but are unsure how high a price to offer The main complication is this the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking Indeed the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome If the project fails the company under current management will be worth nothing $ 0/share But if the project succeeds the value of the company under current management could be as high as $ 100/share All share values between $ 0 and $ 100 are considered equally likely By all estimates the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management In fact whatever the ultimate value under current management the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T If the project fails the company is worth $ 0/share under either management If the exploration project generates a $ 50/share value under current management the value under Company A is $ 75/share Similarly a $ 100/share value under Company T implies a $ 150/share value under Company A and so on The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company Ts shares This offer must be made now before the outcome of the drilling project is known From all indications Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A provided it is at a profitable price Moreover Company T wishes to avoid at all cost the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press Thus you Company A will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer In addition Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the per share value of the company under current management Thus if you offer $ 50/share for instance Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $ 50 As the representative of Company A you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $ 0/share this is tantamount to making no offer at all to $ 150/share What price offer per share would you tender for Company Ts stock $ ______ per/share

May 22 2001 Page C03 The Carlyle Group the Washington based global investment firm boasts an enviable roster of world class financiers including former defense secretary Frank Carlucci former secretary of state James Baker former budget director Richard Darman and former British prime minister John Major But as of last Friday it no longer enjoys the services of junior analyst Peter Chung whose international fame is starting to rival that of his elders and betters The Posts Carrie Johnson reports that the 24 year old Chung a 1999 economics graduate of Princeton University who had worked for Merrill Lynch in New York before joining Carlyle was ordered to resign from his job in the firms Seoul office after he sent a shockingly vulgar e mail detailing his sexual ambitions in South Korea After it was sent last Tuesday Chungs e mail proliferated all over the Internet headlining the online industry newsletter PrivateEquityCentralnet and made the grayly eminent Carlyle Group blush deep crimson So Ive been in Korea for about a week and a half now and what can I say LIFE IS GOOD Chung e mailed a dozen friends Ive got a spanking brand new 2000 sq foot 3 bedroom apt Why do I need 3 bedrooms Good question the main bedroom is for my queen size bed where CHUNG is going to bleep every hot chick in Korea over the next 2 years 5 down 1000000000 left to go the second bedroom is for my harem of chickies and the third bedroom is for all of you bleepers when you come out to visit my butt in Korea CHUNG is KING of his domain here in Seoul Last Thursday when Chungs e mail found its way back to headquarters the ax fell quickly Carlyle Managing Director David Rubenstein told The Posts Johnson I can confirm on the record that hes no longer an employee Chungs former colleagues remained puzzled yesterday by his message A Carlyle source told Johnson Hed only been here five days Ask Merrill Lynch if he did anything like this Merrill Lynch spokesman Joe Cohen told us We have no comment on any statements made or activities taken after Mr Chung left Merrill Lynch But Cohen confirmed that Chung was a summer intern in 1997 and 1998 and then a full time employee in New York from July 1999 to April 2001 Our calls to Chung were not returned yesterday His younger brother Patrick told us We have no comment at this time Hes still in Seoul May 22 2001 New York Times An E Mail Boast to Friends Puts Executive Out of Work By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN Hold on Do not press send A young click happy financial executive is wishing that he had never touched his computers left mouse button last Tuesday Paul Chung a recently hired associate at the Carlyle Group in its office in Seoul South Korea was forced to resign on Friday after boasting about his sexual exploits and lavish lifestyle in an e mail message to 11 buddies at Merrill Lynch in New York where he used to work Unfortunately for Mr Chung a 24 year old Princeton graduate who had moved to Seoul three days earlier to start his job the message was forwarded or passed on to thousands of people on Wall Street and wound up being sent to his bosses at Carlyle the private equity firm Mr Chung was given the option of resigning or being dismissed a Carlyle executive said The message which was retitled Amazing Cautionary Tale by a banking analyst meandered in and out of e mail boxes around the world I know I was a stud in NYC but I pretty much get about on average 5 8 phone numbers a night and at least 3 hot chicks that say that they want to go home with me every night I go out I love the buy side Mr Chung wrote in the message using the companys network He bragged about his spanking brand new 2000 sq foot three bedroom apt with a 200 sq foot terrace He bragged that he used one bedroom for his harem and another for other sexual exploits Mr Chung also boasted about his job I have bankers calling me every day with opportunities he wrote and they pretty much cater to my every whim you know golfing events lavish dinners a night out clubbing Reached by telephone in Seoul Mr Chung said Its devastating I really cant comment Sorry Mr Chung is the latest in a string of employees to lose their jobs or be publicly embarrassed by a sexually explicit e mail message that was forwarded to others In a much publicized e mail message last year that made its way to hundreds of thousands of in boxes an employee of a British Internet provider wrote to her boyfriend about a sex act Employees of many different companies that passed the message along to friends were dismissed David M Rubenstein a founder and managing director of the Carlyle Group had no comment The Carlyle Group is known for its investments in military companies and its prominent list of advisers including Arthur Levitt the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and James A Baker III the former secretary of state One analyst that passed along the message to his investment banking colleagues attached this prophetic message

Korea over the next 2 years 5 down 1000000000 left to go Chung sent the message May 15 to 11 friends via the Carlyle e mail system according to PrivateEquityCentralnet Carlyle founding partners Bill Conway and David Rubenstein couldnt immediately be reached to comment on the Internet report The private equity firm with more than $ 13 billion under management has one of its largest investments in Korea where it spent about $ 300 million to buy a stake in KorAm Bank the countrys eighth largest commercial lender Carlyle whose owners include the California Public Employees Retirement System counts former President George Bush and former Prime Minister John Major of Great Britain among its advisers Chung asked that condoms be sent by Federal Express because he was running out and that he goes out to Koreas finest clubs every other week night and both weekend nights much of it paid for by the investment banks seeking advisory fees from Carlyle `` I think in about 2 months after I learn a little bit of the buyside business Ill probably go out every night on the weekdays Chungs e mail said Carlyle Contacts Washington DC based Carlyle has zoomed to prominence partly through its

Subject The Story Gone Awry of a Private Equity Stud Another Wall Streeter apparently fell victim to the perils of the Digital Age last week when an associate from prominent Washington DC investment firm Carlyle Group reportedly was forced to resign after a risqu e mail he sent to friends became a chain letter among investment banks around the world The incident began innocently enough when a Peter Chung who represented himself to be a junior staffer in Carlyles Seoul office sent an e mail to 11 friends boasting of the lavish lifestyle and sexual exploits he is enjoying in his new buy side position In a May 15 e mail obtained by The Post Living Like A King Chung brags in lewd detail about how he gets on average 5 8 phone numbers a night and how at least 3 hot chicks that want to go home with him every time he goes out He goes on saying he loves the buy side because bankers pretty much cater to my every whim you know golfing events lavish dinners a night out clubbing He concludes the e mail by asking his friends to send him condoms by FedEx because he was running out of them The executive was forced to resign from Carlyle Friday less than two weeks after his hiring according to Net news service PrivateEquityCentralnet Carlyle partner David Rubenstein did not return repeated phone messages Chung could not be reached However in a May 17 e mail purportedly sent by him to a friend he denied writing the e mail that sparked the controversy That e mail quickly circulated to hundreds of eager readers who in some cases added their own mocking commentaries One reader called the e mail kind of a pimpin aint easy version of the Uberconsumer from several years back Another marked it as a lesson of why one should never put anything in print The most biting satire entitled The True Story of a Private Equity Stud urged recipients of the e mail to contact former Secretary of State James Baker a senior counselor at Carlyle Carlyle Associate Resigns Following Raunchy E Mail Incident By David Snow May 21 2001 A junior professional in The Carlyle Groups Seoul office was forced to resign Friday after a raunchy e mail he sent to friends was forwarded to thousands of people around the world The junior professional an associate sent the message on May 15 to 11 friends via his Carlyle e mail account In the message the associate expressed excitement about his new position with the Washington DC based private equity giant But the associate mostly described in bawdy detail the lavish lifestyle and various sexual conquests he enjoyed as a young buyside professional The e mail made its way to thousands of financial professionals and others around the world and two days later made it to top partners at The Carlyle Group according to a source familiar with the situation Carlyle executives found the e mail totally inappropriate the source said and were particularly concerned about the mocking commentary that accompanied the message as it was sent from person to person One lengthy commentary described private equity professionals as arrogant and profiting from the hoarding of capital and satirically urged recipients of the forwarded message to contact Carlyle senior counselor James Baker The e mail highlighted the firm in a very negative way and it was taken very seriously the source said The associate resigned last Friday after having been employed by Carlyle for less than two weeks The Carlyle incident is similar to the Brad and Claire incident that originated in London late last year in which an employee of law firm Norton Rose forwarded to friends an explicit e mail from his lover The message was forwarded to an estimated 10 million people and eventually made it to the front pages of the British tabloids The Norton Rose employee was subsequently disciplined but not fired In his e mail the Carlyle associate bragged about having investment bankers cater to my every whim you know golfing events lavish dinners a night out clubbing He said his goal was to sleep with every hot chick in Korea Carlyles Seoul office responsible for leading Carlyles $ 300 million investment in KorAm Bank of South Korea last year its largest deal ever is headed

Email body:Hi I hope you are all ok I am sorry for any losses that may have touched your friends and family I looked at the ICE/LCH announcements I have a few questions 1 Will ICE be able to work as a deal entry system as well as mechanism to post markets My concern here is that under the Deutsche proposal we would be able to do a deal with you over the phone and then post it to their system and no other market participant would be able to see that transaction it would then go straight to the clearing Currently Id say that only 2 % of the time ICE has a tighter market than EOL this because they do not have the liquidity and likely will not There is not a high probability we would ever contribute to this liquidity over our own system Enron online so the ability to deal directly with you in still imperative 2 Can margin at LCH be netted across products Looking forward to speaking Thanks and Regards Caroline

Email body:ill pay a grand total of 0 Eva Pao epao @ mba2002hbsedu on 05/10/2001 051559 PM Please respond to epao @ mba2002hbsedu To jarnold @ enroncom cc Subject try this one Please read the following problem very carefully and write in a number at the end You should be ready to defend your answer Only a number is allowed not an algebraic equation Acquiring a Company In the following exercise you will represent Company A the acquirer which is currently considering acquiring Company T the target by means of a tender offer You plan to tender in cash for 100 % of Company Ts shares but are unsure how high a price to offer The main complication is this the value of Company T depends directly on the outcome of a major oil exploration project it is currently undertaking Indeed the very viability of Company T depends on the exploration outcome If the project fails the company under current management will be worth nothing $ 0/share But if the project succeeds the value of the company under current management could be as high as $ 100/share All share values between $ 0 and $ 100 are considered equally likely By all estimates the company will be worth considerably more in the hands of Company A than under current management In fact whatever the ultimate value under current management the company will be worth fifty percent more under the management of A than under Company T If the project fails the company is worth $ 0/share under either management If the exploration project generates a $ 50/share value under current management the value under Company A is $ 75/share Similarly a $ 100/share value under Company T implies a $ 150/share value under Company A and so on The board of directors of Company A has asked you to determine the price they should offer for Company Ts shares This offer must be made now before the outcome of the drilling project is known From all indications Company T would be happy to be acquired by Company A provided it is at a profitable price Moreover Company T wishes to avoid at all cost the potential of a takeover bid by any other firm You expect Company T to delay a decision on your bid until the results of the project are in then accept or reject your offer before the news of the drilling results reaches the press Thus you Company A will not know the results of the exploration project when submitting your price offer but Company T will know the results when deciding whether or not to accept your offer In addition Company T will accept any offer by Company A that is greater than the per share value of the company under current management Thus if you offer $ 50/share for instance Company T will accept if the value of the company to Company T is anything less than $ 50 As the representative of Company A you are deliberating over price offers in the range of $ 0/share this is tantamount to making no offer at all to $ 150/share What price offer per share would you tender for Company Ts stock $ ______ per/share

Email body:PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL As folks are aware we have been engaged in closed door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market based solution to Californias electricity crisis In the room are the major large customer groups environmentalists small customers TURN Independent Energy Producers labor the Western States Petroleum Association and Enron The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly Bob Hertzberg When Hertzberg convened the meeting he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure similar to the structure in place in Californias gas market ie large customers are required to buy gas from the market with Direct Access available to all other customers In effect core customers rez and small business would be served by the utilities retained generating assets and QF contracts and large customers would go to market The core/noncore structure would begin 1103 The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis but who pays for the utilities past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious Unfortunately with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts The problem is that if core is served by utility gen and QFs and large customers are in the market there is no or very little need for the DWR contracts Instead they look like a signficant stranded cost Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address the DWR contract problem in order to prevent the contracts from 1 killing the core/noncore deal and 2 forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any out clauses that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions My cursory review of the contracts suggests that outs for the state are minimal or nonexistent In addition weve started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts All this said want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyones contract rights Wed like to have a quick call tomorrow 30 60 minutes to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive Wed like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT Please let me know if this works for you and if it doesnt please let me know if theres a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you Thanks Jeff

of The Wall Street Journal 06/04/2001 The Wall Street Journal A4 Copyright c 2001 Dow Jones & Company Inc WASHINGTON President Bushs chief political strategist owns hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies potentially affected by the presidents top legislative priorities newly released federal records show Karl Rove one of the presidents most trusted advisers on almost every major legislative initiative owns between $ 100000 and $ 250000 of stock in Enron Corp Pfizer Inc General Electric Co Boeing Co and Johnson & Johnson among other holdings Federal law requires public officials to report their assets income and debts in broad ranges only All of these companies could be affected by one or more of the policies or legislative initiatives on which the president consults Mr Rove tax cuts increased defense spending an industry oriented energy policy and health care reform Mr Rove said yesterday that he has been waiting for several months for approval from the Office of Government Ethics to sell all of his stock holdings and roll the proceeds into a diversified account without having to pay capital gains taxes as permitted by federal law In the meantime I have had to avoid being involved in matters that specifically and materially affect my specific holdings Mr Rove said Mr Rove said he filed his financial disclosure reports Dec 30 and was later informed by the Office of Government Ethics that he should sell all of his stock holdings to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest But the government ethics office which couldnt be reached for comment yesterday has yet to officially grant Mr Rove a certificate of divestiture which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified accounts according to White House spokeswoman Anne Womack It appears that Mr Rove has lost tens of thousands of dollars as a result of the delay because most of his stocks have lost value since the beginning of the year Mr Rove insisted that he has been careful to avoid any discussions that directly affect companies he is invested in as federal conflict of interest laws require But that cant be easy for Mr Rove widely regarded as one of the most powerful and influential figures in the White House Mr Rove serves as the presidents top political adviser and runs the administrations long term strategy team He is also the presidents top liaison to outside groups including corporations Hes involved in virtually every decision that is made here says a White House aide It is unclear how many times if ever Mr Rove recused himself from discussion inside the White House President Bush already under fire from Democrats for his administrations close ties to industry is likely to draw more scrutiny as a result of the new disclosures of financial links between top White House officials and major US corporations especially energy firms The White House disclosed the personal finances of Mr Rove and several other top administration officials at the behest of the media It appears that as a result of an administrative backlog Mr Rove is the only member of the senior staff who hasnt been given the green light to sell his stock according to a White House aide The reports show that Mr Rove was one of several White House officials with a financial connection past or present with Enron and other energy companies Larry Lindsey the presidents top economic adviser who helped draft the energy plan received $ 50000 from Enron in 2000 for consulting work he did for the company the documents show Lewis Libby chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney who was chairman of the White House task force that wrote the energy plan recently sold tens of thousands of dollars of stock in Enron and other energy companies including Texaco Inc Exxon Mobil Corp and Chesapeake Energy Corp It is unclear when the transaction went through Clay Johnson director of presidential personnel reported holding between $ 100000 and $ 250000 in El Paso Energy Partners LP And National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice had $ 250000 to $ 500000 worth of Chevron Corp stock and was paid $ 60000 last year for her work as a director at the company

GOES UP usually comes down And few industries are more prone to boom and bust than energy Imagine the news stories a few years from now Crisis hangover energy stocks sink as prices plunge But California consumers still stuck with high bills The energy industry is suffering its worst downturn since the supply glut of the 1990s as dozens of big new power plants come on line and the just completed Alaskan gas pipeline sends natural gas prices to their lowest levels in six years The one bright spot for Texas generators is California where consumers are locked into long term contracts for wholesale electricity that the state signed at the peak of its blackouts in the summer of 2001 Sacramento lawmakers have appealed to President Daschle to help get the state off the hook arguing that California will never claw its way out of its economic slump if businesses continue to flee to states where energy is cheap But top Enron lobbyist Gray Davis a former governor of California warned Daschle that suppliers would have little choice but to go to court to enforce the contracts the state signed Washington and Sacramento are agog with the energy crisis and bursting at the seams with plans to fix it But the one thing no one even environmentalists suggests is letting high energy prices discourage energy consumption or encourage new supplies To economists letting the price rise is the solution said Paul Portney president of Resources for the Future a Washington think tank To elected representatives having the price go up is the problem Political memories tend to be selective and short But it was the energy glut of the 1990s that contributed to Californias blackouts $ 3 gasoline and $ 400 a month heating bills Likewise high prices are now laying the seeds of their own destruction As a story in the New York Times noted an energy investment boom promises a cyclical increase in supplies that is expected to stabilize or reduce prices in coming months many industry executives and private analysts say Through much of the 1990s there was a glut of energy Fuel of all kinds was really cheap How cheap Adjusted for inflation as cheap as in 1949 economists calculate Energy is the oxygen of the economy and rock bottom prices contributed to the long economic boom But low prices also caused energy production to slump and consumption to soar People ditched their economy cars for SUVs Houses got bigger ceilings got higher and kitchens sprouted industrial stoves with enough BTUs to melt aluminum Stores offices and homes turned into summertime refrigerators Low prices discouraged energy development Oil was so cheap for so long that people were selling their refineries Portney said You had virtually no exploration for new natural gas when prices were at $ 2 a BTU As demand soared and supply fell prices rose Profits have grown so robust that green fuels such as biomass and wind are becoming economically viable The oil industry is booming Refineries are expanding The long delayed construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska now looks likely So many power plants are under construction that the market may be flooded with as much as 200000 new megawatts by 2004 Investments in energy efficiency from new age superconducting transmission wires to better light bulbs are suddenly looking attractive for the first time in decades High prices will dampen demand high prices will encourage supply and will encourage people to make better use of what theyve got said Robert Ebel director of energy for the Center for Strategic and International Studies So were starting on the down slope Were not very far down When prices start to decline I cant say how far they will go But they will decline because thats just the law of supply and demand Prices decline demand starts to creep up again theres less incentive to add to supply and here we go again Copyright 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc All Rights Reserved INDIA Rating firms may be judging India harshly analysts By Vidya Ranganathan 06/04/2001 Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited 2001 BOMBAY June 4 Reuters Analysts have reacted with surprise to last weeks decision of ratings agency Fitch to cut Indias sovereign ratings outlook to negative from stable and say there are no grounds to downgrade the country Fitch which rates Indias foreign currency obligations at BB plus a notch above Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors cited concerns about fiscal policy privatisation and deterioration in foreign investment climate However economists speculated it could either be on account of Fitch adjusting its ratings in line with other global agencies or a fallout of US energy giant Enron Corps threat to exit an Indian power venture over payments problems Moodys and S & P said on Friday they have not revised ratings or outlook but are disappointed with fiscal reform efforts Local currency and stock markets reacted nervously to the announcement but economists said most concerns were exaggerated When the direction of reforms is positive and government flows are improving the outlook should not change said Mohan Nagarajan chief economist at local rating agency CARE Ltd Even if the provocation for the rating review was the Enron episode analysts said the problems were specific to the power sector and will not affect the robust foreign investment the country has been receiving Enron was a bad deal made on unreasonable terms in the first place and does not reflect the ability of the government to pay its dues said an economist with a US based fund Some of the confusion arises from the various ratings assigned to India Moodys has retained a positive outlook on its Ba2 rating since late 1999 while S & P has a stable outlook and a BB rating CONCERNS OVERSTATED Analysts said none of the factors Fitch cited had deteriorated in the past year since it first rated India Fitch said Indias fiscal monetary mix was unfavorable real interest rates were high and there was the risk of a debt trap India marginally overshot its budgeted fiscal deficit in 2000/01 April March to 52 percent of GDP down from the previous years 56 percent But laws to control government spending are awaiting parliaments approval there are incentives for disciplined state governments and a determined effort at privatising state run firms has begun Burgeoning fiscal deficits have persisted for a decade and public debt at 60 percent of GDP is high but at six percent annual growth India is one of the fastest expanding economies in Asia In terms of external liquidity India is much stronger than its BB+ rating while even its public debt to GDP ratio is lower than that of some Asian nations said PK Basu chief economist for South East Asia at Credit Suisse First Boston Singapore Foreign investment has been pouring in portfolio flows at $ 22 billion so far in 2001 are at record levels and compare with $ 156 billion for the whole of 2000 and foreign exchange reserves are strong at $ 428 billion Interest rates and yields have also dropped with the Reserve Bank of India RBI adopting an aggressive easing stance this year to prop the slowing economy and inflation is benign The hardest initial steps are being taken and there is still a lot of inertia but soon there will be a willing audience and reforms can progress faster CAREs Nagarajan said But critics said the changes were still very superficial and structural reforms that would spur long term growth and demand were lacking What the rating agencies have emphasised is fiscal consolidation which means better revenue streams efficient expenses user charges for public utilitieswe promised these three years back and havent moved very far on those said Saumitra Chaudhari economist with local rating agency

Corps troubled Dabhol Power Company begin a two day meeting in Singapore on Tuesday to try and settle differences over continued support to a controversial $ 29 billion power project in India Representatives of some of the worlds largest banks like Citibank ABN AMRO and Bank of America will be at the meeting Indian lenders like the Industrial Development Bank of India State Bank of India and ICICI will also participate Market analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint stand on supporting the project which now produces 740 MW of power and is slated to increase it to 2184 MW shortly in its second phase But it comes against a backdrop of rising tension between Dabhol and the Indian state utility the Maharashtra State Electricity Board MSEB which is the sole buyer of Dabhols electricity Indian lenders who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant want to continue supporting the project But they are being opposed by offshore lenders who want to withdraw their loans Loans of around $ 638 million of the offshore lenders are covered by guarantees provided by Indian institutions The Indian lenders fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pull the plug plan to oppose any such move But they have been forced on the backfoot by MSEBs decision last week to stop buying power from Dabhol and terminate its 1995 contract with the company under which it agreed to lift the entire output The MSEB has complained that Dabhol produces costly power while Dabhol has blamed MSEB for defaulting on payments worth $ 48 million Last month Dabhol issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to sell power It has also filed for arbitration in London This provoked MSEB to haul Dabhol before a local regulatory body the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulatory Commission MERC which issued a temporary order staying the arbitration proceedings The dispute has already affected Indias image among foreign investors Last week global rating agency Moodys expressed concern over slippage in the Indian governments reform programme and cited the Enrons dispute as an example that the country may be losing credibility with foreign investors The dispute indicates that Indias government may not be willing to live up to its contractual obligations As a consequence this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into the country Moodys said Indias federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tried to dispel those fears in an interview with Reuters on Sunday India is always in favour of making sure that international contracts are respected he said There is no need for concern $ 1 = 47 Indian rupees Copyright 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc All Rights Reserved INDIA UPDATE 1 Indias Prabhu says power reforms enter new phase By Clarence Fernandez 06/04/2001 Reuters English News Service C Reuters Limited 2001 BOMBAY June 4 Reuters Indias reforms of its sputtering power sector have entered a new phase with plans afoot to free up private supply overhaul debt ridden state utilities and recraft tariffs Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told Reuters With investors fears fanned by a squabble between US energy giant Enron Corp and a local utility Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday that India is standing behind international contracts Sanctity of contracts has to be kept Prabhu said The row began late last year when the utility in western Maharashtra state defaulted on payments of $ 48 million to Dabhol Power Company 65 percent owned by Enron The 2184 MW power project is Indias largest foreign investment at $ 29 billion Prabhu has vowed to take Indian reforms in a new direction Absolutely he said in reply to a question whether Indias reforms have entered a different phase The Power Ministry will now also focus on power distribution he added besides its early preoccupation with generation needs In India unfortunately for the last 10 yearsreforms policy was skewed in favour of generation he said We never really realised that distribution is the more important part of the process Prabhu added We have now decided we will make enough structural changes in distribution so that at the end of distribution enough investment is made CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT A chartered accountant Prabhu hails from the verdant regions of Indias western coastal strand and chaired a co operative bank that was one of the countrys largest in terms of deposits before his foray into politics An errant lock of hair straying across his forehead Prabhu eschews the Indian politicians traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for the shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered government and whom local media call technocrats Prabhu said India has decided to allow private producers to sell power direct to consumers lifting curbs that have hobbled the countrys decade old reform effort He said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask Indias states to permit third party sales of power which analysts have called a stumbling block for foreign investment They can not force a generator to sell power only to the SEBs and thats a major change we are trying to make Prabhu said referring to the states SEBs or state electricity boards are owned by the state governments and supply power to most of India India estimates that 100000 MW of fresh capacity will have to be installed over the next 12 years to meet its power needs Most of the $ 200 billion in funds that will be required will have to come from foreign private investment But Indias spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors wary Bureaucratic procedures legal delays and political wrangling have held up reform moves RATING REVISED TO NEGATIVE Last week global rating agency Fitch revised Indias sovereign rating outlook to negative from stable citing fiscal concerns the slow pace of privatisation and deterioration in the countrys foreign investment climate Competing agency Moodys sees signs of slippage in the reforms and Standard & Poors has expressed worries over Indias budget deficit Prabhu said he wants to overhaul state power utilities by introducing standard accounting policies cutting transmission and distribution losses to 15 percent and tackling crushing debt thus helping to lure foreign investment into the sector The poor financial health of the utilities expected to run up combined losses of about $ 6 billion in the 2001/02 fiscal year has proved a hurdle in efforts to draw private investment Prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure SEB finances looking at technical commercial and tariff issues is expected to report within a few weeks For the first time we will be preparing commercial data which is internationally accepted We will be preparing technical data which is internationally appreciable And thirdly well be creating an information base which will be created by experts and then made available to the states he said The utilities transmission and distribution losses run to up to 25 percent of the electricity they generate compared to a figure of about eight percent internationally he said Prabhu wants to trim this to about 15 percent within two or three years In the case of India I am willing to accept a figure of 14 percent to 15 percent because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but commercially unviable he added Other steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern region with the rest of India efforts to boost plant load factors through modernisation of equipment and to persuade people to use energy more efficiently Prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves through a programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power cheap or even free as many did in the past $ 1=47 Indian rupees Copyright 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc All Rights Reserved Nigerian president slams US energy firm Enron for poor performance 06/04/2001 BBC Monitoring Source The Guardian web site Lagos in English 4 Jun 01/BBC Monitoring/c BBC Text of article by Francis Obinor entitled Obasanjo chides Enron on Lagos power project published by Nigerian newspaper The Guardian web site on 4 June For failing to live up to expectation of the Nigerian government and the people as regard its role in the Independent Power Project IPP initiated by the Lagos State government two years ago Enron the American firm got a hard knock from President Olusegun Obasanjo at the weekend 2 3 June In his conclusion Obasanjo accused Enron a major player in the electricity project of poor performance and bad faith Ostensibly angry at the delay in the projects full take off and the 30 MW recently connected to the national grid from the scheme the president on the American Cable News Network CNN declared Enron has played a dirty game on us Dirty game in two ways Beside putting up an exorbitant price the company according to the president also failed to comply with the terms of the contract Continuing Obasanjo said The price at which they Enron have tried to sell power to us has been very exorbitant Two what they told us they would do they have not done While refusing to disclose the firms charges Enron Vice President of Marketing John Ambler said the primary objective of the company was to get the project on stream We have a project that is very close to coming on line he said stressing that the companys desire is to see the project work effectively in Nigeria especially in Lagos He added that Enron is committed to the IPP and assured Lagosians that they would soon begin to feel the impact The state government brought forward the June 2001 deadline it set for the commencement of the first phase of the project when it fired the first 30 MW of electricity to the national grid two weeks ago At the Government House on 23 May Governor Bola Tinubu said his administration and the contracting firm felt that there was no harm in bringing the date forward and assured that another 30 MW would be added soon He noted that contrary to expectations that the project would cover the entire state at a go it would be in phases and the focus for now would be industrial consumption The concentration for now is not as private homes we would soon get there Tinubu assured The controversial IPP programme which the federal government had at one time been accused of frustrating has suffered several setbacks including Enrons initial plan to sell its shares to AES another American company Last April was originally fixed for the projects take off but the failure of Trevi a construction company in charge of transmitters caused a shift in the date Copyright 2000 Dow Jones & Company Inc All Rights Reserved India India and Bush Administration Beyond assumptions 06/04/2001 Business Line The Hindu Copyright C 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd KSL Source World Reporter TM Asia Intelligence Wire SOON after Mr George W Bush Jr won the US elections Indian observers proclaimed quickly that a Republican administration bodes good for India A Republican administration was expected to not pester India about human rights violations in Kashmir not force it to sign the CTBT and get tougher with China Mr George Bushs decision to drop by the External Affairs Minister Mr Jaswant Singhs meeting with the American National Security Advisor Ms Condoleezza Rice seemed to somehow confirm this false sense of euphoria This narrow thinking fails to understand the drivers of Republican ideology The reality is the Republicans care about a range of issues that will force the BJP Government to make some difficult decisions Take the first issue of human rights violations in Kashmir It is true there are many isolationists in the Republican Party who probably do not care about human rights violation in Kashmir so long as it does not affect them and is not happening in their backyard But there is another powerful force in Republican politics the religious wing This includes powerful members of the US Cabinet such as The Attorney General Mr John Ashcroft who are Christian fundamentalists Mr Bush himself claims to be a born again Christian The religious right is rarely interested in foreign policy it mostly concerns itself with moral and social issues such as abortion and teenage pregnancy But the few times it does intervene it is when it feels a country is persecuting Christians And when it does intervene no Republican administration dares cross it For instance China is periodically identified as a country that persecutes Christians Christian missionaries and ministers are routinely harassed and imprisoned because they are trying to spread their religion Because of this issue Republican members of the Christian right in Congress have all but declared a religious war on China routinely opposing any attempt to improve relations including trade relations with that country India as an emerging power is more carefully watched and frequently mentioned in the American press Stories of Christian missionaries being burnt alive and nuns raped are attributed to elements associated with the Hindu fundamentalist ruling party In its latest human rights report the US State Department noted these acts with concern The Popes mention of these issues to the Prime Minister Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee was also noted in the American press India is perhaps half a step away from being branded as a country that persecutes Christians A self professed born again Christian like Mr George Bush would quickly take up the Christian rights cause trumping all other bilateral issues Human rights may not matter to the isolationists but Christian and to a lesser extent Jewish religious freedom matters tremendously to a Republican administration The second fallacy was that since the Republicans in Congress did not pass the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty they would not force other countries to pass the CTBT either But why are the Republicans are opposed to the CTBT The opponents of the CTBT feel that it fails to safeguard American security They frankly care little about Indian security They would love to be able to restrict Indias ability to test and use its weapons To them nuclear weapons not in American hands translates into an unsafe world Unless India manages to convince the Republicans otherwise the Republican administration is likely to tighten the anti proliferation screws on India The third fallacy relates to a tough long term strategic re alignment the Bush Administration will demand of India Mr Bushs foreign policy makers are unreconstructed Cold Warriors In the post Cold War era they are desperately searching for an enemy They appear to have settled on China as the next enemy Their next step is to search for allies who rarely challenge their views Thinkers in Washington and New Delhi believe that India and the US are natural allies But such a decision has an enormous range of long term consequences for India To discuss just a few Most of the Indian militarys equipment comes from Russia and the former Soviet Union Allying with the US will be seen by the Russians as abandoning them and this could have an enormous impact on the legacy military equipment Recent noises from the Foreign Ministry suggest India is also eager about Mr George Bushs proposed missile defence programme But this technology is far from proven and during the decade over which it may be developed if it gets past Congress China will most certainly develop many nuclear weapons These may primarily be a deterrent against the US but it will force India into an arms buildup it can barely afford The Americans are reserving their missile defence system for their closest allies India today is neither fish nor fowl not quite a threat but not quite an ally either It is unlikely that India will be able to convince the Americans to give it the defence system Even if the Americans agree to sell it to India it could never afford the sticker price So before it rejoices at the notion of anti China hawks in the White House let India ponder over the unexamined consequences The final issue is one that may precipitate in the very near term Enron and Maharashtra find themselves in a dispute that neither wants to lose and that appears to be rapidly getting shriller Mr George Bushs background is as a Texas oilman and he is widely accused in the US of being beholden to the interests of the energy industry In fact they were among the biggest contributors to his campaign The Enron Chairman Mr Kenneth Lay is a friend of Mr Bushs and was seriously considered for a job in his Cabinet He is so well connected that he was recently accused of influencing who is appointed by the White House to regulate the energy industry In the near term Mr Bush could quite possibly lean heavily on New Delhi to make sure that Enrons interests are not neglected If New Delhi does not respond to his satisfaction his opinion of India and consequently his administrations dealings with the country are likely to be coloured far more than we think Giridhar Srinivasan

Comment 2001 06 04 0629 New York Sydney June 4 Bloomberg Joseph Hirl chief executive of Enron Corps Japanese unit Enron Japan Corp comments on the outlook for deregulation of Japans electricity industry He spoke at the Coaltrans Asia conference in Sydney On Japanese government policy `` The government does have a strong commitment to deregulation but there are some significant policy concerns including a `` greater than 80 percent reliance on imports of energy `` The market has been open a bit over a year however not much has happened No genuine competition exists under the current system The companies there recognize that it will happen Its inevitable `` The level of competition in Japan now is similar to the US in 1994 95 or Europe in 1996 97 Prices are about 400 percent higher than the US `` To put it in perspective I wont give the name of this large chemical company but it consumes about 600 megawatts If you compare that business with a company thats just like it in Houston Texas the difference would be about $ 250 million a year in the cost of electricity `` For such an export led economy thats a difficult situation to be in and its contributing to the overall malaise in the economy On the likelihood of a California style electricity crisis in Japan `` Despite exploitation of California by the utilities METI Ministry of Economy Trade and Industry and others recognize it was a problem of design not competition in California

any questions please contact Kristin Walsh at 713 853 9510 Bridge Loan Financing Bills May Not Meet Their May 8th Deadline Due to Lack= of Support Sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the= bond issuance/bridge loan by the May 8th deadline Any possibility for a= deal has reportedly fallen apart According to sources both the Republic= ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis The Democratic cauc= us is reportedly unwilling to fight for Davis Many legislative Republic= ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that o= nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund Davis would double= dip into the fund Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg= islature and the governor However it is believed once Davis discloses th= e details of the power contracts negotiated a bond issuance will take plac= e Additionally some generator sources have reported that some of the lon= g term power contracts as opposed to those still in development require t= hat the bond issuance happen by July 1 2001 If not the state may be in = breach of contract Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th= e bridge loan legislation by May 8th having a bond issuance by July 1st wi= ll be very difficult The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat= e would eat the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General= Fund thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately = $ 8 billion However the reportedly now are not going to offer even this = concession Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful= l disclosure of the governors plan for handling the crisis including the = details and terms of all long term contracts he has negotiated before they= will support the bond issuance to go forward Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan AB 8X and AB = 31X AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds This bi= ll passed the Senate in March but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac= k of Republican support AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo= r community college districts However sources report this bill may be am= ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen curre= ntly in AB 8X Senator Bowens language states that the state should get = paid before the utilities from rate payments which if passed would be li= kely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy=20 =20 According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature Republic= ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in = the General Fund For instance Tony Strickland has stated that only 1/2 = of the bonds or approximately $ 5 billion should be issued Other Republ= icans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds The Republicans intend= to bring this up in debate on Monday Additionally Lehman Brothers repo= rtedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind= ications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan =20 Key Points of the Bridge Financing Initial Loan Amount=09 $ 4125 B Lenders=09=09JP Morgan=09=09 $ 25 B =09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09 $ 10 B =09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09 $ 625 M Tax Exempt Portion=09Of the $ 4125 B $ 16 B is expected to be tax exempt Projected Interest Rate=09Taxable Rate=09=09577 %

Yesterday but Little Can be Done at This Time The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday which authorizes $ 5 billion to create t= he California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority The $ 5 billion= authorized under SB 6X is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be aut= horized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased or the addi= tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power = going forward Again the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz= ations Without the details of the long term power contracts the governor = has negotiated the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is = that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support No f= urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB 6X until it = is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchas= ing power Also there is no staff defined purpose etc for the Calif= ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority However this can be consi= dered a victory for consumer advocates who began promoting this idea earl= ier in the crisis =20 SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy At this point two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy T= he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the = governor The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au= gust 15th however some decision will likely be made earlier According t= o sources the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal though SoCal has s= igned it The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi= s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass If the legislature indicat= es that it will not pas the MOU SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank= ruptcy or its creditor involuntary due to the lack operating cash =20 The second likely triggering event which is linked directly to the bond is= suance would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X bridge loan s= tating that the DWR would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers th= en the utilities would receive the residual amount In other words the st= ate will get paid before the utilities If this language is included and p= assed by the legislature it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for= bankruptcy SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and= the DWR proportionately from rate payments

Email body:Carlos Can you help me with several 1031 exchange questions I spoke to your office and they thought it best that I address my questions to you directly Here is my situation I purchased a 32 acre tract in Leander about 8 months ago I have a contract to sell the property which should close around July 18th I expect to realize a gain of around $ 400000 See calculations below Sales price 2100000 Purchase price 1200000 Fees & Devel costs 500000 Profit 400000 The cash generated at the sale will be close to $ 1 million after repayment of a loan I am interested in protecting this gain through a 1031 exchange I am already involved in a couple of other real estate transactions that might qualify First there is a 10 acre tract that was purchased by Bishops Corner Ltd for $ 115 million six months ago I lent the partnership the cash to buy the land with the intent of working with the developer to build a multifamily project We could not come to terms for the development so the partnership was conveyed to me The loan still exist I am an 80 % limited partner Another investor is the other limited partner We have set up a Corporation to be the general partner We intend to develop the property Is there a creative way to use the land purchase in a 1031 exchange Second I have a small tract in New Braunfels under contract for $ 400000 I am applying for FHA financing for a 180 unit apartment complex and hope to receive an invitation letter prior to closing I would need to place this property in a limited partnership eventually but is there a way to buy the property hold it in my name long enough to satisfy the IRS then move it to a LP If neither of these deals qualify I would still like to find another piece of property My two biggest concerns are tying up too much cash and holding property in my own name Is there a way to insure during the 1st year then move a different entity Thank you in advance for your help Phillip Allen 8855 Merlin Ct Houston TX 77055 pallen70 @ hotmailcom wk 713 853 7041 hm 713 463 8626

concentrating on the major roles within a desk any more granular could be inaccurate because it is different for every company Admin support answers the phones and Commerical support runs the books in

Email body:Matt As we discussed several times previously including earlier this week Nine Energy Services LLC is a CREDIT WATCH COUNTERPARTY and a WMBE Women and Minority owned Business Enterprises which means that ALL trades need to be approved by Credit and documented with a Resale Agreement Every time we transact ENAs Confirmation Group needs to know from whom to expect payment ie San Diego Gas & Electric The nature of the transaction exposes ENA to secondary risk with the ultimate counterparty On another note some transactions COULD be declined by Credit due to direct exposure/risk that the ENA has with the Counterparty outside of any WMBE Transactions Sitara Deal Number 1014433 was another violation of Corporate Credit Policy In the future please contact Credit before transacting with any Credit Watch Counterparty Darren Vanek

will have a hard time raising a large amount of cash in a short time said Sean Egan managing director of Egan Jones Rating Co `` It takes time to sell assets and many shrewd investors like Goldman Sachs might find it more profitable to just pluck off key employees rather than invest in Enron Egan said The shares pared some of todays losses after CNBC reported that Enron is talking with rival Dynegy Inc about options including a merger Both companies are based in Houston `` We dont comment on market rumors Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel said `` Enron does not comment on speculation on mergers and acquisitions Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett decided against investing in Enron because he wasnt willing to sign a confidentiality agreement that would keep him from trading Enrons debt the New York Times reported today citing an unidentified person close to the talks Other companies approached by Enron including Clayton Dubilier & Rice the Blackstone Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co have also shown little interest the newspaper said The US Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron partnerships run by the

Euro CLN Trust Enron Sterling CLN Trust and Enron CLN Trust and Trust II may have received a higher coupon than an Enron corporate obligation offers The notes which are obligations of the special purpose entities are tied to specific credit events such as a bankruptcy or Enrons failure to pay on obligations Proceeds from the notes were to be used to acquire the Trusts initial investments and buyers are to be paid interest from the proceeds of those certain assets according to an offering memorandum The Trusts can invest in securities with short term ratings of at least `` A1 from S & P and `` P1 from Moodys Investors Service as long as they mature before the maturity dates of the notes There are four notes each divided into two offerings some offered publicly and some privately sold All the notes are scheduled to mature in August 2005 or May 2006 and were sold by a group of banks led by Salomon Smith Barney a unit of Citigroup In the event of an Enron credit event Citibank which acted as a swap counter party to the trusts can take the trusts investments in return for Enron debt obligations The Enron debt is then liquidated by the trust with the proceeds paid to the investors Neither Enron nor Citibank have direct obligations to the holders of the notes according to an offering memorandum Enrons credit linked notes utilize a credit default swap that the trusts have with Citibank that references Enrons senior unsecured debt so the rating on the credit linked notes will reflect the senior unsecured rating S & P said in a report Liz Goldenberg and Terence Flanagan in the New York=20 Former SEC Chairman Levitt Transcript of Interview 2001 11 07 1252 New York ****THE FOLLOWING IS AN UNOFFICIAL TRANSCRIPT**** BLOOMBERG LP DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OF THIS TRANSCRIPT New York Nov 7 Bloomberg The following is a transcript of a Bloomberg interview with Former Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt The reporter is Dylan Ratigan RATIGAN As youve probably heard Enron under investigation by the SEC the SEC looking into partnerships run by their former CFO If you come into the Bloomberg with me I want to show you what its done to the stock price here over the course of the past month month and a half Youre talking about a move from a price in the mid 40s which was not that long ago mind you early mid October to a price that is now $ 967 a share This has absolutely decimated the companys stock price Arthur Levitt the former chairman of the SEC with us looking first of all at whats going on with this company But before I do that let me say good morning to you LEVITT Good morning Dylan RATIGAN Talk to me LEVITT You know there are certain warning signs here that investors have to be careful of related party transactions Anytime you see a related party transaction an investor should be very careful What they were doing was they were simply setting up these partnerships to move off the balance sheet acquisitions and borrowings that would really have hurt the balance sheet and I think given investors a very different picture RATIGAN Well lets just make it real clear to people because they can easily get confused Im a company LEVITT Yes RATIGAN and I create and Im an executive of that company and I create a partnership that has nothing to do with that company legally on paper LEVITT But all the risks and rewards still belong to the parent company The affect of this is the subsidiary borrows the money to make the acquisition from another partnership set up by the parent This stays totally off the balance sheet of the parent company Why does this happen RATIGAN So in other words Company ABC exists they set up Subsidiary 123 LEVITT Yes RATIGAN Subsidiary company 123 borrows money from LEVITT To make an acquisition RATIGAN A bank LEVITT No RATIGAN They borrow money from who LEVITT They issue bonds RATIGAN OK They borrow money from the world LEVITT Yes RATIGAN whoever wants to lend them money LEVITT Yes RATIGAN they borrow money they make an acquisition Now Subsidiary 123 down here has big debts that dont reflect upstairs on Company ABC LEVITT Precisely RATIGAN But ABC still gets to use the asset that was bought by 123 LEVITT Yes RATIGAN OK LEVITT Exactly Now how does it happen The accounting firm that handled this transaction Arthur Andersen received $ 25 million for an audit of the company thats a huge amount and $ 27 million for consulting services another danger sign A lot of dough Those consulting services were to validate these transactions $ 52 million dollars went to the accountants The problem here is an audit committee was not doing its work If you look at Enrons statements and how many times have we heard they were confusing Its the job of the auditing firm to see to it that it is not confusing Thats the real problem Now what can you do about it RATIGAN Tell me LEVITT I think actually the FASB the independent standards setter could put through a rule which says RATIGAN And FASB is the Federal Accounting Standards Board They set the rules LEVITT Yes Located in Norwalk Connecticut They could say if a company sets up another legal entity and the company retains all the risks and rewards of that entity then the public company that public company that set up these entities must consolidate in the P & L in the balance sheet all of these transactions Now how does that come about I think the SEC could urge the FASB to do this In 1990 the present chief accountant of the SEC called for that action to be taken place but at that point the then chief accountant didnt support the move RATIGAN And this creates in your mind a rallying call to reiterate that request with more venom and more passion than before LEVITT I dont know about venom but I RATIGAN But with passion LEVITT I certainly think that passion I think this is clearly a call for better disclosure RATIGAN Fair enough I will see you next week OK LEVITT Good Nice to see you RATIGAN You too

Email body:As you may know the only person more arrogant than an investment banker is someone in private equity Investment bankers pride themselves on making vast amounts of money but a successful private equity professional takes devilish pride and supports an even bigger ego for working fewer hours while making even more money than his rarely her investment banking brethren Unfortunately some members of the private equity community mistakenly believe that their growing wealth is the result of their own talent and charming personality rather than a simple profiting from the hoarding of capital as Karl Marx so astutely described Consider the plight of Peter Chung see attached email a recent hire at the Carlyle Group After completing his two year stint as an Analyst at Merrill Lynch Chung was persuaded to seek out new opportunities in Korea working as part of Carlyles vast Asian investment team Working at a private equity firm allows Chung to check out Korean night clubs which would be legally classified as brothels in the United States 3 4 times a week though Chung made it clear that he needs only two months to learn a little bit of the buyside business so he can begin nightly visits Already a self described stud on the New York City dating scene Chung looked to the emerging island of Korea where the standard of living for young foreign men is bolstered by the low per capita income of native residents roughly $ 12600 per person By making in excess of ten times the average national wage Chung quickly found himself to be quite the ladies man as the locals were attracted to his fat wallet and US citizenship Thus bolstered by an initial rendezvous or two Chung decided to cement his legacy by setting out on the quixotic mission to sleep with all of the fine women of Korea As of May 15 2001 Chung alludes to having had sexual relations with five hot chicks According to Chungs own calculations there are roughly one billion hot chicks remaining in Korea Clearly there is a break in Chungs sexual predator model as he apparently believes that not only is the global female population of 3 billion comprised of 1/3 hot Korean chicks but he will be able to sleep with that many before his finest member falls off or he dies of exhaustion Sadly Chung can not complete his mission alone The quality of prophylactics in Korea are not quite up to US standards Chung would probably claim Korean condoms are too small and he needs your help to continue his quest for infamy If you would like to contribute to this valiant mission please direct your gift of a FDA approved domes to the address below Peter Chung The Carlyle Group Suite 1009 CCMM Bldg 12 Yoido dong Youngdeungpo ku Seoul 150 010 Korea Chung asks that you consider using FedEx or another international overnight courier since he may be on the verge of running out of protection Alternatively if you would like to pursue a job working for The Carlyle Group in Korea write to the following address The Honorable James A Baker 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Suite 220 South Washington DC 20004 2505 Please note that Mr Baker the lead spokesperson for The Carlyle Group a the former Secretary of State from the George Herbert Walker Bush Administration Since leaving the White House Jim Baker has continued his international mission to spread goodwill and STDs throughout the world by supporting young Romeos such as Mr Chung For a first hand account of life in private equity please read Peter Chungs travelogue attached Please keep in mind that Chungs experience is partially a function of his prior status as a stud and may not be reflective of private equity experiences in general Not all of us can hope to be as smart debonair and modest as Mr Chung Regards Justin From Peter Chung pchung @
